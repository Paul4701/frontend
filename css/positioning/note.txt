postion by default is static 
in case of static position is executed accoprding to the html 
same for relative but 
in realtive positioning you can  change the left and right top bottom 
it overflows in relative 
  


  absolute position--
  position absolute will act like there is no other element in the html 
  it will consider it's parent to the element that has position anything except static

  position fixed----
  it fixes a element no matter how we scroll its position is the same

  position sticky-- fisrt its like absolute then its sticky


---------------------

why positioning?
so that we can understand how the elements will float on the browser

--->
    a) static
    b) relative
    c)absolute
    d)fixed
    e)sticky


static-->
by default sob static thake

relative-->
top left right bottom
natural 

absolute-->TLBR
           element positioned
           natural flow doesn't maintain
           scrolls 
fixed-->
      TLBR
      element positioned
      doesn't maintain natiral flow
      position remains same instead of scrolling
      doesn't scroll rest same 

sticky--> hybrid of(relative+fixed)
         natural flow remains 
         doesn't scroll

   works only within sticky container 
   never gets out of the container
